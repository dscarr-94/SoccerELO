# SoccerElo
Databases project for CPE 365. Using data from clubelo.com, create more
advanced/useful queries related to club/nation/league elo.

All date queries should be of the form YYYY-MM-DD.

NOTE: ROOM FOR EXPANSION
we can potentially use current elo to create new matches and predict game
outcomes based off factors such as home field advantage. Can also add a little
randomness to this so we can almost simulate games and not completely know
the outcome
