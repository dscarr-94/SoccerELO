ADDITIONAL TABLES
EloChanges - An EloChanges table should exist, keeping track of team name, date of change, and amount.
	This is so that any elo change query doesn't have to perform a cross product of the
	ClubEloEntry table with itself (1.2 million * 1.2 million = a lot). Even when narrowing
	the cross product to a specific team, this ends up (on average) creating a table with
	4 million entries.

DATABASE HOST
If we're going to host on a local machine, make sure that it isn't crazy slow, or better
yet, don't host the DB on a local machine. Cloud desktops or servers would be perfect
for this scenario due to the sheer amount of data being processed. Regular laptops can
NOT, I repeat CAN NOT, handle 1.2 million entry tables with any amount of speed.

TRIGGERS
Use triggers to delete out of date records and to update the EloChange table. This would
move the Database management code out of the application, as it should be. Reason for not
doing this: The tables were created and populated before we knew what a trigger was.
